# Sentiment Analysis for Game Scripts
(in Japanese and English)

Polished offshoot of a project originally from my Spring 2023 semester. The previous project used Stanford Coda instead of NLTK for English tokenization, and NLTK instead of MeCab for Japanese tokenization. I've rewritten large portions of the code to be more readable (and hopefully troubleshoot-able), as well as to more easily extend for applications concerning sentiment analysis for documents in both English and Japanese.
